Welcome to my Python framework for chord detection and segmentation from music audio I'm making for my Audiovisual Systems Engineering TFG (Final Degree Project). It uses a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize chords by predicting the root note and chord quality separately. For segmentation, it offers two methods: one based on tempo information, and another using cosine differences in the audio's Constant-Q Transform spectrum.
